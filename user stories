+I want to create a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) containing a start state.
+I want to be able to add states to the DFA in order to set all possible states of the automaton.
I want to be able to create transitions between the elements to create the logic of the automaton
+I want to be able to input an list of symbols to the automaton
	+I want the DFA to stay in the starting state if the input list was empty
+I want to know whether the machine is in accepting state after processing the input
+I want the DFA to always start in the same state before processing any input so that each input results in the same state after processing
+I want to be able to determine the name of the current state of the DFA
+I want to be able to determine whether the current state of the DFA is accepting

+I want to be able to unambiguously identify states so that duplicate states within an automaton may be prevented
